                          <p><strong>While Eichler homes are usually associated with the Mid-Century Modern heyday of the 1950s and 1960s, the legendary developer built homes well into the early &rsquo;70s. Built in 1972, this Palo Alto, CA, stunner has hit the market at $2,699,000 and is a prime example of the Mid-Century aesthetic extending into the initial years of the Me Decade.</strong></p>
                          <p>
                            The four-bedroom, two-bathroom home offers 1,978 square feet of living space and a spacious backyard designed for entertaining.
                            Listing agent Tim Foy said this home is from &ldquo;One of Eichler&rsquo;s last tracts. It may be the very last tract in Palo Alto.&rdquo;
                          </p><img src="<?php echo base_url('public/');?>media-demo/properties/870x480/02.jpg" alt="">
                          <p>Foy told us the home was purchased over 40 years ago before hammer even hit nail, and the original buyers were able to specify customizations and upgrades not seen in many other Eichlers. One of their requests was to have the knot-free redwood paneled walls extend into the open-air atrium at the center of the home. The home&rsquo;s stunning cathedral ceilings are beautiful redwood and give the home a warmth not usually associated with Eichlers.</p>
                          <blockquote>&ldquo;When you walk in the front door, all the redwood creates a warmth,&rdquo; said Foy. &ldquo;It feels really homey. It&rsquo;s truly an &lsquo;aha!&rsquo; moment for a lot of people. Of course, the home appeals to Eichler lovers&mdash;but it also appeals to people who weren&rsquo;t prepared to like an Eichler.&rdquo;</blockquote>
                          <p>As with all Eichler homes, the integration of indoor space and outdoors is key. Floor-to-ceiling windows along the back of the house let in plenty of natural light and create a seamless flow. Extensively remodeled inside and out over the past couple of years, the home&rsquo;s current owners thoughtfully and faithfully documented all of the updates they&rsquo;ve made. The home&rsquo;s price tag reflects its Palo Alto address, and Foy told us the market at the epicenter of the Bay Area shows no signs of slowing. While the college city continues its red-hot pace, the agent told us he&rsquo;s also seen renewed interest in Palo Alto Eichlers:</p>
